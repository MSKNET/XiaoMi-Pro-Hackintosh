## Introduction

| ------ | ---------- |
| TM1701 | [XMAKB5R0P0603](TM1701/XMAKB5R0P0603), [XMAKB5R0P0906](TM1701/XMAKB5R0P0906), [XMAKB5R0P0A07](TM1701/XMAKB5R0P0A07.exe), [XMAKB5R0P0E07](TM1701/XMAKB5R0P0E07.exe) |
| TM1707 | [XMAKB5RRP0C05](TM1707/XMAKB5RRP0C05.exe) |
| TM1905 | [XMACM500P0401](TM1905/XMACM500P0401.exe) |

These BIOS packets are from Xiaomi official or after-sale service.

~The ME firmware in [ME](ME) folder is from [Fernando's Win-RAID Forum](https://www.win-raid.com/t596f39-Intel-Management-Engine-Drivers-Firmware-amp-System-Tools.html). Using the latest ME firmware helps to avoid potential malicious attack. The ME firmware version in the folder is `Intel CSME 11.8 Consumer PCH-LP Firmware v11.8.55.3510` and the version of `Intel (CS)ME System Tools` is `Intel CSME System Tools v11 r14 - (2018-08-09)`.~

**Warning: Since the operations are related to BIOS, it's possible that if some errors(such as force quit the update program) occur during the update process(so as to scripts in [#8](https://github.com/stevezhengshiqi/XiaoMi-Pro/issues/8)), the whole system may unable to boot.**

If unfortunately, this situation happens on you, you need to find Xiaomi stuff to fix your device. If you use this program, you should agree that you are the person who takes the whole responsibility, instead of the author.


## TM1701

### Update History

#### XMAKB5R0P0906

- A new setting `KB Backlight Mode` appears in BIOS panel. Users can choose `Power Saving` (default, KB backlight off when keyboard idle 15s) or `Standard` (KB backlight always on in S0 mode)
- Reduce fan noise when CPU is running in low load

#### XMAKB5R0P0A07 & XMAKB5R0P0E07

- I have no idea about these versions. The packet providers don't give much information.
- On my laptop, the `KB Backlight Mode` - `Standard` is not working on XMAKB5R0P0A07.
- It's very easy to upgrade to these versions. Just download and run the exe file.


### How to Update

#### XMAKB5R0P0603

**It's allowed to downgrade to this version**

1. Prepare a FAT32 U-disk, download all the files in [XMAKB5R0P0603](TM1701/XMAKB5R0P0603) folder and put them into the root directory of the U-disk.

2. Reboot the laptop with AC charge on, press `F12`, and choose the U-disk entry.

3. In the shell interface, type `unlockme.nsh`, and then the device may reboot. After that, repeat the second step and type `flash.nsh`.

4. Wait until the install process completes.

#### XMAKB5R0P0906

 As the old proverb says "Fight no battle unprepared", **backing up important data is always a good choice.** Some users face with blue screen after running the updating program.

1. Download all the files in [XMAKB5R0P0906](TM1701/XMAKB5R0P0906) folder.

2. Run `H2OFFT-Wx64.exe` with administrator.
  - IMPORTANT: From this step, your computer should keep in charged by AC adapter until the whole update process finishes.

3. A warning may appear, ignore it and update.

4. The laptop will restart, wait until the update process ends.

#### XMAKB5R0P0A07 and Above

Just run the exe file. Make sure AC power is connected during the update.


### How to Unlock Better Performance

[FallenChromium](https://github.com/FallenChromium) and [Cyb](http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php?showuser=914121) created scripts for changing DVMT size from 32mb to 64mb, unlocking MSR 0xE2, and editing Embedded Controller(EC) firmware to reduce fan nosie. Scripts are in [DVMT_and_0xE2_fix](TM1701/DVMT_and_0xE2_fix). For more information, you can visit [#8](https://github.com/stevezhengshiqi/XiaoMi-Pro/issues/8) and [cybsuai's repository](https://github.com/cybsuai/Mi-Notebook-Pro-tweaks).

After running those scripts, you need to delete `framebuffer-fbmem` and `framebuffer-stolenmem`, edit `framebuffer-flags`, and disable MSR 0xE2 patch in `config.plist`.
- Open `/EFI/CLOVER (or OC)/config.plist`, delete the following code:
```xml
  <key>framebuffer-fbmem</key>
  <data>AACQAA==</data>
  <key>framebuffer-stolenmem</key>
  <data>AAAwAQ==</data>
```
- Then edit the `framebuffer-flags` to enable `FBEnableDynamicCDCLK`
```diff
  <key>framebuffer-flags</key>
-   <data>CwfDAA==</data>
+   <data>CwfjAA==</data>
```
-  For Clover users, change the following code to disable MSR 0xE2 patch:
```diff
    <key>KernelPm</key>
-   <true/>
+   <false/>
```
-  For OC users, change the following code to disable MSR 0xE2 patch:
```diff
    <key>AppleXcpmCfgLock</key>
-   <true/>
+   <false/>
```

| BIOS Lock | 0x17 | SETUP | 0x0:Disabled, 0x1:Enabled | 0x1| 0x0 |

After modifying these configurations, you need to delete `framebuffer-stolenmem` and disable MSR 0xE2 patch in `config.plist`.
- Open `/EFI/CLOVER (or OC)/config.plist`, delete the following code:
```xml
  <key>framebuffer-stolenmem</key>
  <data>AADgAQ==</data>
```
-  For Clover users, change the following code to disable MSR 0xE2 patch:
```diff

-   <true/>
+   <false/>
```
-  For OC users, change the following code to disable MSR 0xE2 patch:
